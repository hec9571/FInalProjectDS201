# GPA and Common Behaviors of College Students

## Introduction

   College students have been notoriously known for doing activities outside of their classes and being a diverse community with combatting interests.  High school students have increasingly become more likely to go to college and with five thousand three hundred colleges in the states currently we see how popular College is today.  This is a time in a student’s life where they go out and try new things which helps them have a taste of adulthood before entering the working world.  During college, men and women are at their physical peak and it is an excellent time where we see much growth in individuals.  But with everything there are elements in college that can negatively or positively affect one’s physical or mental health.  There are health issues that could arise from heavy drinking, drug use and other factors such as anxiety.  However, independence could lead to better sleep patterns, making new friends and healthier life choices such as more exercise.  In addition, decisions on how long you prepare for exams or even how many meals you have a day could affect your performance in school.  All these newfound responsibilities can hinder or enhance your performance so it will be interesting how these variables interact.

  The results of one study at Purdue University showed that the mean GPA for student organization members and officers was significantly higher than the mean GPA for those not in these organizations (Relationship between Undergraduate Student Activity and Academic Performance Amy L. Hawkins).  This shows that involvement in campus activities could lead to more engagement in school which in turn helps them attain better grades.  Also in the same study they found a negative correlation between fraternity involvement and GPA but a positive correlation between sorority involvement and GPA.  Greek life has been known to help students find a group of friends to hang out with but can increase one’s activities outside the classroom.  Drugs, alcohol and behaviors such as skipping class could arise from this which could substantially affect our grades.  

  But with this there is a decent amount of people that argue that this level of independence at college is needed for growth and is actually ultimately a benefit to your experience.  Making your own decisions will ultimately help you more in the long run and help your academic performance.  Also if people don’t want to be so involved around campus that could translate them to being much more focused on their schoolwork.  This could lead them to attaining better grades even though they are not taking advantage of all that college has to offer.  So ultimately these behaviors could not have a dominant effect on us, everyone is different and being at college could still not change people that much.  

  With this in mind we decided to analyze the following question: **How do common behaviors of college students affect GPA?** We want to see how aspects of Greek life involvement, hours of studying, alcohol use and other factors affect our academic performance at college.

  This study focuses on college students with a multitude of different attributes gathered.  This will hopefully help us understand how life in college affects our performance in the classroom.  Ultimately, we are college students and we want to see how our activities and thoughts in college have a negative or positive effect on our performance.
